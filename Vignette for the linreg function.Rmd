## What Does the Linreg function do?

The linreg function can be found in the GitHub repository AU-R-Programming/FinalProjectGroup8

The function appears as my_lm in the R code and is accompanied by a help file:
my_lm = function(y, x, alpha, approach)

This function allows the user to perform a linear regression with their own data. The user can select an alpha value and whether to use a bootstrap or asymptotic approach.

The function returns the confidence intervals for beta, a Mean Square Prediction Error (MPSE) in matrix form, 
an F-test and p-value. In addition the function outputs plots for the residual vs. fitted values, a qq-plot of residuals and a histogram (density) of the resideuals. 

## How to Use the Function

We are using an example dataset which can be downloaded from our R package called forestfires.csv.

The linreg function appears in the format:  my_lm = function(y, x, alpha, approach)

After attaching the dataset, the user would first state the sample size (n=517), then set up the y and x values:

CODE HERE

and then select an alpha value, such as 0.05 and then type whether they want a "bootstrap" or "asymptotic"
approach. 

The resuling code should look like: 



This will return the aforementioned values in the output and the graphs in the plots window.
