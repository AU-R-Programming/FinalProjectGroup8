# FinalProjectGroup8
Repository for Yu, Lynn and Jacobo for our final project
This repository contains the necessary code to run a linear regression. It gives the user the option to use an asymptotic or bootstrap approach and the ability 
to set the alpha value. It returns a mean square prediction error (MSPE), an F-test, and creates plots for the residuals, residual vs. fitted values, 
and a histogram of the residuals.
